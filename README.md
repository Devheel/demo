Verify is a reputation protocol that tracks the transaction history of participants (buyers, sellers) and unlocks benefits for those with good reputation.

## Introduction
This is the MVP for Verify

## Setup Instructions
```bash
npm install
gulp

## Purpose of MVP
The purpose of this demo is to help sellers, and general users alike, to understand how the Verify solution differs from traditional payment solutions &mdash; and how the checkout experience may look like.

This demo is illustrative, and will of course change with time, to optimize for conversion and usability. However, it's primary purpose is to demonstrate the checkout experience.
